# Github Pages

After your pull request has been merged by a maintainer, it is now time to get DNS providers ready.

If your provider that was used inside of your JSON not Github, please go to another page of this DNS category. If you did use Github in your JSON, please follow this guide.

Head to the repository where your code and the github link used in your JSON was fetched from.&#x20;

Once you have reached your repository, click Settings -> Pages. Once you see the "Source" dropdown, select Github Actions.&#x20;

In the "Custom Domain" field, type in your subdomain, for example, mine would be trollmeight.stole-my.id. After that, you can now press "Save".

After all of that, your website is now ready for usage!
