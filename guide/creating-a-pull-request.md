# Creating a Pull Request

Now that you have completed making the fork and creating the JSON file, it is now time to create a pull request so your domain goes into effect!

Navigate to the [stole-my.id](https://github.com/stole-my-id/registration) repository and head to the "Pull Requests" tab

Once you have reached the Pull Requests area of stole-my.id, press the "New pull request" button.

Replace the \[] part after the requirements to \[x] after you have done what asked.&#x20;

Once filled out, make the pull request and you should be finished with this process of making pull requests! Wait until a maintainer merges your pull request and your domain should be in effect once merged.
