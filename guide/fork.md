# Creating a Fork

Creating a fork is an easy process to get ready to make your brand new subdomain!&#x20;

First, go to the repository for [stole-my.id](https://github.com/stole-my-id/registration) and make sure you are logged into Github.

Once you are logged in and on the stole-my.id Github repository, press the "Fork" button in the top right. Feel free to name the fork whatever you want.&#x20;
